        PROJECT WORK SUMMARY REPORT
================================================================================
Date        : February 2026
Project     : EduGovern - Academic Management System
Modules     : Admin Module + Staff (Faculty) Module + Student Module
Tech Stack  : React (Vite), Node.js / Express, MySQL, Cloudinary,
              JWT Authentication, Recharts (Data Visualization)
================================================================================


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION 1 : SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

EduGovern is a full-stack web application built with:

  Frontend  : React (Vite), React Router, Axios, Recharts
  Backend   : Node.js, Express.js, JWT Authentication Middleware
  Database  : MySQL (raw queries, no ORM)
  Storage   : Cloudinary (assignment file attachments)
  Auth      : JWT-based token authentication with role-based access
               (admin / staff / student roles protected via middleware)

The application is split into two separate portals:

  1. Admin Portal          (localhost:5173) — Managed by school administration
  2. Staff/Student Portal  (localhost:5174) — Used by teachers and students

Both portals share a single MySQL database ("edugovern") and communicate
with their respective backend servers via REST APIs.

Key database tables:
  students, classes, sections, subjects, exams, student_marks,
  faculty (staff), announcements, messages, homework_assignments,
  homework_submissions, feedback, requests, transport (buses, maintenance),
  admin


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION 2 : DATABASE CHANGES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

2.1  Removed exam_name column from exams table
     ─────────────────────────────────────────
     Problem  : The exams table had both exam_name and exam_type columns,
                causing redundancy.
     Solution : Removed exam_name entirely and made exam_type the sole
                identifier for an exam.

     Steps taken:
       • Created migration script:
           database/remove-exam-name-use-exam-type.sql
         This script:
           1. Backfills exam_type from exam_name where exam_type was empty
           2. Sets exam_type NOT NULL with DEFAULT 'Assignment'
           3. Drops the exam_name column

       • Updated schema definition files:
           - database/create-exams-table.sql
           - database/create-exams-table-standalone.js
           - src/config/mysql.config.js

2.2  student_marks table (faculty-entered marks)
     ────────────────────────────────────────────
     The faculty portal uses a student_marks table with columns:
       id, student_id, staff_id, subject, exam_type, marks,
       max_marks, exam_date, created_at, updated_at

     This table is populated by teaching staff through the Staff Portal
     and is read by both the Admin Portal and Student Portal for progress
     analytics.


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION 3 : ADMIN MODULE — FEATURES IMPLEMENTED
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SECTION 7 : BUGS FIXED
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  #   Bug Description                          Fix Applied
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  1   MySQL "Illegal mix of collations"         Refactored deleteMark and
      error when deleting marks                 updateMark from 3-table JOIN
                                                to two separate queries to
                                                avoid cross-table collation
                                                comparison.

  2   Incorrect "already exists" alert          Removed auto-selection of
      shown for other students in               default subject/exam type on
      Mark Entry page                           student selection. Added
                                                !marksLoading guard to
                                                existingMarkForForm check.

  3   Inaccurate dates in progress              All exam_date SELECT queries
      trend chart (timezone shift)              now use DATE_FORMAT(exam_date,
                                                '%Y-%m-%d'). Frontend uses
                                                string-split parsing instead
                                                of new Date() to avoid UTC
                                                midnight shift.

  4   CORS error: PATCH method blocked          Added 'PATCH' to the
      for extend-due-date API                   corsOptions.methods array
                                                in server/app.js.

  5   Admin Student Progress showing            Replaced placeholder logic
      100% for all students (incorrect          (max_marks used as obtained)
      marks)                                    with real data fetched from
                                                student_marks table via
                                                /api/marks API.

  6   Student Progress class dropdown           Changed class/section lists
      only showing classes that have            to be populated from classes
      enrolled students                         and sections DB tables
                                                directly, not from student
                                                records.

  7   Exam Progress Timeline showing            Added smart label
      duplicate labels for same                 deduplication: if same
      exam type on different dates              type+subject appears more
                                                than once, date is appended
                                                to the label automatically.

  8   Unknown column 'e.exam_name' in           Removed exam_name from all
      ORDER BY clause after migration           backend queries; updated
                                                ORDER BY to use e.exam_type.

  9   recharts library not installed            Executed npm install recharts
                                                in the admin client directory.

SECTION 8 : UI / STYLING DECISIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  - All faculty pages (Mark Entry, Assignment, Announcement) share a
    consistent design language:
      * White page background with 0.5px border and 10px border-radius.
      * 22px/600 page title.
      * Controls row with bottom border separator.
      * Inner white card (border: 1px solid #e8e8e8, border-radius: 8px,
        box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)) wrapping content.
      * Individual item cards: #fafafa background, 12px border-radius,
        hover lift effect.

  - Delete buttons use a consistent outlined style:
      * Transparent background, red border (#fca5a5), red text (#ef4444).
      * On hover: light red fill (#fef2f2), darker red border.

  - Assignment type badges are color-coded:
      * Assignment = Blue, Activity = Purple, Project = Cyan,
        Vacation = Amber, Other = Grey.

  - Admin Student Progress charts use:
      * Blue (#2563eb) for student scores.
      * Indigo (#6366f1) for Section A in comparisons.
      * Pink (#ec4899) for Section B in comparisons.
      * Amber (#f59e0b) for average reference lines.
      * Dark tooltip (#1e293b background) with subject breakdown on hover.

  - Academic Setup cards:
      * Grouped by class, each class in its own card.
      * Card header shows class name + item count.
      * Items listed with Edit (blue) and Remove (red) action buttons.


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION 9 : KEY DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOLLOWED
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
       Admin, staff, and students see only their own relevant data.
       All API routes protected by JWT middleware.

  2. Data Integrity:
       UPSERT logic prevents duplicate marks.
       Cascade delete for assignments removes all submissions.
       Deadline enforcement prevents late submissions.
       exam_type NOT NULL with default prevents empty exam records.

  3. Timezone Safety:
       All date values handled as YYYY-MM-DD strings server-side.
       Frontend parses dates by string-splitting, not new Date() constructor,
       to avoid UTC midnight timezone shift bugs.

  4. Consistent UI/UX:
       All pages share the same design system (colors, typography, spacing).
       Interactive feedback: loading spinners, success/error messages,
       confirmation dialogs before destructive actions.

  5. Responsive Design:
       All pages adapt to smaller screen sizes using CSS media queries.

  6. Clean Code:
       Separate service files for each API domain.
       Reusable helper functions (safeDateStr, formatDateLabel, getGrade,
       buildSubjectMap, buildTrendMap, buildCompareData, classOrder).
       useMemo used throughout for expensive derived data computations.
