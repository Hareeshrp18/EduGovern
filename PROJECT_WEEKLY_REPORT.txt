Week - 1  |  Project Idea & Overview
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Project Ideas Discussed:
Project Title: EduGovern - Academic Management System

Topic Discussion:
The application will use React (Vite) for the frontend and Node.js with
Express.js for the backend. MySQL will serve as the relational database, and
RESTful APIs will facilitate communication between the frontend and backend.
JWT-based authentication will ensure secure, role-based access for admin and
staff users.

Project Overview:
EduGovern is a comprehensive web-based Academic Management System designed to
streamline school administration and faculty operations. The platform provides
school administrators with a centralized dashboard to manage students, teachers,
classes, sections, subjects, exams, transport, announcements, and academic
progress analytics. It simultaneously empowers teaching staff with tools to
record student marks, manage assignments, track student progress, and submit
feedback — all within a single integrated system.

The project addresses the common challenges faced by educational institutions
that rely on manual record-keeping and disconnected tools. By digitizing the
entire academic workflow, EduGovern reduces administrative overhead, improves
data accuracy, and enables data-driven decisions through real-time analytics and
progress charts. The system is designed with a strong emphasis on role-based
access control, ensuring that each user type — admin or staff — sees only the
data and actions relevant to their role.

The architecture separates the Admin Portal and the Staff Portal into two
independent frontend applications, both communicating with a shared backend
server and a single MySQL database. This separation ensures clean boundaries
between administrative and instructional responsibilities while maintaining a
unified data layer.

Core Modules:
1. Admin Module   : Student management, teacher management, academic setup
                    (classes, sections, subjects, exams), announcements,
                    transport, reports, and student progress analytics.
2. Staff Module   : Mark entry, assignment management, student progress view,
                    announcements, feedback submission, messages, and
                    request/approval handling.

Project Scope and Requirements:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a school management system
that enables seamless academic record management, faculty-student interaction,
and administrative oversight. The system must efficiently handle student data,
exam records, and assignment workflows while providing insightful progress
analytics to both administrators and teaching staff.

Challenges & Solutions:
  Security        : Implementing JWT-based authentication with role-specific
                    middleware to ensure secure access control for admin and
                    staff roles.
  Database Design : Using MySQL with carefully normalized tables and foreign
                    key relationships to maintain data integrity across students,
                    marks, assignments, and academic records.
  Real-Time Data  : Optimizing API responses and React state management to
                    ensure charts and progress views reflect the latest marks
                    data without page reloads.
  Scalability     : Designing a modular Express.js backend with separate
                    controllers, models, and routes for each domain, enabling
                    easy addition of new features without disrupting existing
                    functionality.

Week - 2  |  System Architecture & Technology Stack and Database Schema Design
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

System Architecture Design:
This week focused on designing the overall system architecture and finalizing
the technology stack. The architecture separates concerns clearly across the
frontend, backend, and database layers to ensure maintainability and scalability.

Key Components of the Architecture:

Frontend (React + Vite):
  Two independent React applications were planned:
    1. Admin Portal  — for school administrators (runs on port 5173).
    2. Staff Portal  — for teaching staff (runs on port 5174).
  Both applications use React Router for client-side navigation, Axios for API
  communication, and Recharts for data visualization. Protected routes are
  implemented using a ProtectedRoute component that checks for a valid JWT
  token before rendering any page.

Backend (Node.js + Express.js):
  A single Express.js server handles all API requests for the Admin Portal.
  A separate Express.js server handles Staff Portal API requests.
  Both servers follow a modular architecture with dedicated folders for
  controllers, models, routes, middleware, and configuration.
  JWT authentication middleware protects all API endpoints, verifying the
  Bearer token on every request before allowing access.

Database (MySQL):
  MySQL was chosen for its relational capabilities, enabling structured joins
  across students, classes, sections, subjects, exams, and marks tables.
  Raw SQL queries (no ORM) were used for full control over query optimization.

File Storage (Cloudinary):
  Assignment file attachments (PDFs and images) are uploaded to Cloudinary
  via Multer middleware, returning a secure URL stored in the database.

Database Schema Design:
The following tables were designed and created:

  Table Name             Key Columns
  ─────────────────────  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  admin                  id, admin_id, name, email, password_hash
  students               id, student_id, name, class, section, roll_no,
                         date_of_birth, student_password, created_at
  faculty (staff)        id, staff_id, name, email, password_hash, class,
                         section, subject, created_at
  classes                id, name, display_order, created_at
  sections               id, name, class_id (FK → classes), display_order
  subjects               id, name, class_id (FK → classes), display_order
  exams                  id, class_id (FK → classes), subject_id (FK → subjects),
                         exam_type, exam_date, max_marks, description
  student_marks          id, student_id (FK → students), staff_id, subject,
                         exam_type, marks, max_marks, exam_date,
                         created_at, updated_at
  homework_assignments   id, staff_id, title, description, type, class,
                         section, due_date, created_at
  homework_submissions   id, assignment_id (FK), student_id, notes,
                         file_url, submitted_at, status
  announcements          id, title, content, recipient, scheduled_time,
                         created_at
  feedback               id, staff_id, student_id, category, comments,
                         created_at
  messages               id, sender_id, receiver_id, content, created_at
  requests               id, student_id, type, reason, status, created_at
  buses                  id, bus_number, route, driver_name, capacity
  maintenance            id, bus_id (FK → buses), issue, status, reported_at

Key Design Decisions:
  - exam_name column was intentionally excluded from the exams table.
    exam_type serves as the sole identifier for an exam type, keeping the
    schema clean and avoiding redundancy.
  - student_marks is a separate table from exams, allowing staff to enter
    actual obtained marks per student independently of exam definitions.
  - sections table has a foreign key to classes, enabling the system to
    always show the correct sections for any selected class.
  - All date columns use DATE or TIMESTAMP types; queries use DATE_FORMAT
    to return YYYY-MM-DD strings, preventing timezone shift issues on the
    frontend.

Work Done This Week:
  - Finalized system architecture diagram.
  - Designed complete database schema with all tables and relationships.
  - Set up MySQL database and created all tables.
  - Initialized both React (Vite) frontend projects.
  - Initialized both Node.js/Express backend projects.
  - Configured CORS, JWT middleware, and Cloudinary in both servers.
  - Set up project folder structure (controllers, models, routes, services,
    pages, components) for both frontend and backend.

Week - 3  |  Admin Module — Part 1
           |  Authentication, Dashboard, Student & Teacher Management,
           |  Academic Setup (Classes, Sections, Subjects)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

This week focused on building the core administrative features of the Admin
Portal, starting with authentication and the foundational management modules.

Admin Authentication:
  JWT-based login was implemented for admin accounts. On successful login, the
  server generates a signed JWT token which the frontend stores in sessionStorage
  and attaches to all subsequent API requests via an Axios request interceptor.
  A ProtectedRoute component wraps all admin pages, redirecting unauthenticated
  users to the login screen. The admin sidebar navigation was built with the
  following sections: Dashboard, Students, Teachers, Announcement, Transport,
  Messages, Request/Approval, Report Generate, Academic Setup, Student Progress,
  and Logout.

Student Management:
  The Students page allows the admin to view, add, edit, and delete student
  records. Each student record contains: name, student ID (auto-generated in
  format 1@sks, 2@sks), roll number, class, section, date of birth, and a
  system-generated password derived from the student's date of birth (ddmmyy
  format, bcrypt-hashed). A search and filter functionality allows the admin to
  quickly locate students by name or ID.

Teacher (Faculty) Management:
  The Teachers page provides CRUD operations for faculty records. Admin can add
  new teachers with their name, email, assigned class, section, and subject.
  Each teacher receives login credentials to access the Staff Portal.

Academic Setup — Classes, Sections, and Subjects:
  The Academic Setup module was built with a tabbed interface covering Classes,
  Sections, Subjects, and Exams. This week, the Classes, Sections, and Subjects
  tabs were completed.

  All three tabs were designed with a card-based layout grouped by class,
  replacing the earlier plain table design. Each class is displayed as a card
  showing the class name, item count, and a list of associated items (sections
  or subjects) with Edit and Remove buttons. React's useMemo hook was used to
  group and sort data efficiently without redundant re-computations.

  Key implementation details:
    - Classes are sorted in educational order: PreKG → LKG → UKG → 1 → 2 → 12.
    - Sections are linked to classes via a foreign key; the UI groups sections
      under their respective class cards.
    - Subjects are similarly grouped by class with the same card layout.
    - An empty state is displayed when no items exist for a tab.
    - All CRUD operations are backed by RESTful API endpoints:
        GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/academic/classes
        GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/academic/sections
        GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/academic/subjects

Work Done This Week:
  - Implemented admin login with JWT authentication.
  - Built admin sidebar navigation with protected routes.
  - Completed Student Management page (CRUD + search).
  - Completed Teacher Management page (CRUD).
  - Built Academic Setup — Classes tab (add, edit, delete, card layout).
  - Built Academic Setup — Sections tab (grouped by class, card layout).
  - Built Academic Setup — Subjects tab (grouped by class, card layout).
  - Applied consistent card-based UI design across all three tabs.


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Week - 4  |  Admin Module — Part 2
           |  Academic Setup (Exams), Announcements, Transport,
           |  Messages, Request/Approval, Report Generate
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

This week completed the remaining Admin Portal modules, covering exam
configuration, communication features, transport management, and report
generation.

Academic Setup — Exams Tab:
  The Exams tab was added to the Academic Setup module, completing the four-tab
  interface. Exams are defined per class and optionally linked to a subject.
  Each exam record stores: class, subject, exam type, exam date, max marks, and
  an optional description.

  The Exam Type field was implemented as a free-text input rather than a fixed
  dropdown, giving the admin the flexibility to define any exam type such as
  "Quarterly Test 1", "Unit Test 2", or "Practical Exam". The input includes a
  placeholder ("e.g. Midterm, Final, Assignment") and trims whitespace before
  saving. The exam cards follow the same class-grouped card layout used for
  sections and subjects, with each card showing the exam type, subject, date,
  and max marks alongside Edit and Remove buttons.

  A database migration script (remove-exam-name-use-exam-type.sql) was created
  to remove the legacy exam_name column from the exams table, consolidating
  exam identification into the exam_type column alone. The backend model was
  updated to reflect this change, and the ORDER BY clause was updated from
  exam_name to exam_type.

Announcements Module:
  The Announcements page allows the admin to create and publish announcements
  targeted to specific recipients (faculty, students, or all). Each announcement
  card displays the title, content preview, recipient group, and posted date.
  Admin can delete announcements. The backend filters announcements by recipient
  type when serving them to the Staff Portal.

Transport Module:
  The Transport module covers bus and maintenance management. Admin can add and
  manage bus records (bus number, route, driver name, capacity) and log
  maintenance issues for each bus with status tracking (pending, in-progress,
  resolved).

Messages Module:
  The Messages module enables internal communication between admin and staff.
  Messages are displayed in a conversation-style list with sender details and
  timestamps. The frontend polls for new messages at regular intervals to keep
  the inbox updated without requiring a page refresh.

Request / Approval Module:
  The Request/Approval page displays all student requests (such as leave
  applications) submitted through the Student Portal. Admin can approve or
  reject each request, updating its status in the database. The list is
  filterable by status (pending, approved, rejected).

Report Generate Module:
  The Report Generate module provides the admin with downloadable reports
  covering student records, faculty records, and academic data. Reports are
  generated server-side by querying the relevant tables and returning structured
  data to the frontend for display and export.

Work Done This Week:
  - Completed Academic Setup — Exams tab (free-text exam type, card layout).
  - Created database migration script to remove exam_name column.
  - Updated backend academic model to use exam_type throughout.
  - Built Announcements module (create, view, delete, recipient filtering).
  - Built Transport module (bus management, maintenance tracking).
  - Built Messages module (internal messaging with polling).
  - Built Request/Approval module (approve/reject student requests).
  - Built Report Generate module (student and faculty reports).


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Week - 5  |  Admin Module — Part 3
           |  Student Progress Analytics Module
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

This week was dedicated entirely to building the Student Progress Analytics
module — the most data-intensive feature of the Admin Portal. This module
enables the admin to view, compare, and analyse academic performance across
classes, sections, and individual students using interactive charts.

Backend — Marks API:
  A new marks module was created in the admin server to read from the
  student_marks table (populated by teaching staff). Three API endpoints
  were implemented:

    GET /api/marks?studentId=&class=
      Returns all mark records for a specific student or class, joining
      with the students table to include student name, class, and section.

    GET /api/marks/summary?class=&section=
      Returns one row per student with their average percentage, total
      obtained marks, total max marks, and exam count — grouped by student
      for a given class and optional section.

    GET /api/marks/timeline?class=
      Returns per-exam class averages grouped by exam_date + exam_type +
      subject, sorted chronologically. This powers the Exam Progress
      Timeline chart on the overview page.

  All three routes are protected by the authenticate middleware. The marks
  module was registered in app.js as app.use('/api/marks', marksRoutes).

Frontend — Student Progress Page:
  A new page (AdminStudentProgress.jsx) was created with a dedicated CSS file
  and registered as a protected route at /admin/student-progress. A "Student
  Progress" menu item was added to the admin sidebar.

  Class & Section Selection:
    The page opens with a selector panel containing two dropdowns — Class and
    Section. The Class dropdown is populated directly from the classes database
    table, ensuring all classes (PreKG to Class 12) appear regardless of whether
    any students are enrolled. The Section dropdown is populated from the sections
    table filtered by the selected class. A third "Compare Section" dropdown
    appears when the selected class has more than one section, enabling
    side-by-side section comparison. A context badge displays the current
    selection (e.g. "Class 10 › B vs C").

  Class Overview Tab:
    The overview tab displays a ranked student list on the left with a search
    box, and two charts on the right stacked vertically. The first chart is a
    horizontal bar chart showing each student's average score percentage with a
    dashed reference line marking the section average. The second chart is the
    Exam Progress Timeline — a scrollable row of exam cards (showing exam type,
    subject, date, class average %, and max marks) above a line chart plotting
    the class average percentage across all exams over time. Smart label
    deduplication was implemented: when the same exam type and subject appear on
    multiple dates, the date is automatically appended to the label to avoid
    confusion (e.g. "Midterm · English (2026-02-17)" vs
    "Midterm · English (2026-02-22)").

  Section vs Section Compare Tab:
    When a Compare Section is selected, a new tab appears showing summary cards
    for both sections with their average percentages and student counts, a VS
    panel declaring which section leads and by how much, side-by-side ranked
    student lists for both sections, and a grouped bar chart comparing student
    averages across both sections on the same axis.

  Individual Student Tab:
    Clicking any student in the ranked list opens their individual progress view
    showing their rank badge, average percentage, and a diff badge indicating
    how they compare to the section average (e.g. +5.3% vs section avg). Three
    charts are displayed: a subject-wise average bar chart, a progress trend
    area chart by exam date, and a subject strength radar chart (shown when the
    student has marks in three or more subjects).

  Student vs Student Compare Tab:
    From the individual student view, the admin can select a second student from
    a dropdown listing all students in the same class across any section. A
    compare tab then appears with side-by-side summary cards, a grouped
    subject-wise bar chart, an overlaid progress trend line chart, and an
    overlaid radar chart — all showing both students' data simultaneously.

  Real Marks Integration:
    On page load, the component fetches real marks for all students in a single
    batch using Promise.all, storing results in an allMarksMap keyed by
    student_id. All charts, rankings, and averages are computed from actual
    obtained marks divided by max marks, replacing the earlier placeholder that
    incorrectly showed 100% for all students.

Work Done This Week:
  - Created marks.model.js, marks.controller.js, marks.routes.js on admin server.
  - Registered /api/marks routes in app.js.
  - Built AdminStudentProgress.jsx with full selector panel and four tabs.
  - Implemented Class Overview with ranked list, bar chart, and exam timeline.
  - Implemented Section vs Section Compare tab with VS cards and grouped chart.
  - Implemented Individual Student tab with three chart types.
  - Implemented Student vs Student Compare tab with overlaid charts.
  - Integrated real marks data from student_marks table into all charts.
  - Fixed class dropdown to load from DB tables (not from student records).
  - Fixed duplicate exam labels on timeline chart with smart deduplication.
  - Added marks.service.js to the admin frontend service layer.
  - Installed recharts library (npm install recharts).
  - Added Student Progress route and sidebar menu item.

Week - 6  |  Staff Module — Part 1
           |  Authentication, Dashboard, Students View,
           |  Mark Entry Module
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

This week began development of the Staff (Faculty) Portal, which runs as a
separate React application on port 5174 with its own Express.js backend server.
The focus was on authentication, the staff dashboard, and the core Mark Entry
module.

Staff Authentication:
  JWT-based login was implemented for staff accounts. Staff credentials are
  verified against the faculty table in the database. On successful login, the
  token is stored in localStorage and attached to all API requests via an Axios
  interceptor. Protected routes redirect unauthenticated staff to the login
  screen. The staff sidebar navigation includes: Dashboard, Students, Mark Entry,
  Assignment, Announcement, Messages, View Student Progress, Request/Approval,
  and Feedback.

Staff Dashboard:
  The dashboard provides a summary overview of the staff member's assigned class,
  showing the total number of students, subjects taught, and recent activity.
  The layout uses stat cards for quick metrics and a welcome message personalised
  with the staff member's name.

Students Page:
  The Students page displays all students enrolled in the staff member's assigned
  class and section, fetched from the backend using the staff's class and section
  details from their profile. Students are listed with their name, roll number,
  class, and section. A search box allows filtering by name or student ID.

Mark Entry Module:
  The Mark Entry module is the most critical feature of the Staff Portal. It
  uses a two-panel layout: a scrollable student list on the left and a mark
  entry form on the right.

  When a staff member selects a student from the left panel, the right panel
  loads all existing marks for that student (fetched from the student_marks
  table) and displays them in a table grouped by exam type. The form above the
  table allows the staff to add new marks by selecting a subject, entering the
  exam type, marks scored, maximum marks, and exam date.

  Key features implemented:
    - Add new marks with full form validation.
    - Edit existing marks: clicking the edit icon pre-fills the form with the
      selected mark's data; a Cancel Edit button resets the form cleanly.
    - Delete marks: an inline Yes/No confirmation replaces the delete button
      before the record is removed, preventing accidental deletions.
    - UPSERT logic: if a staff member attempts to save a mark for a
      subject+exam_type combination that already exists for the student, the
      system detects the duplicate and shows a warning banner. The staff can
      then confirm the overwrite, which updates the existing record rather than
      creating a duplicate.
    - Percentage badge: each mark row displays the calculated percentage
      (marks / max_marks × 100) as a colour-coded badge.

  Backend implementation:
    - All exam_date fields are returned using DATE_FORMAT(exam_date, '%Y-%m-%d')
      to prevent UTC midnight timezone shift when the frontend renders dates.
    - The deleteMark and updateMark functions were refactored from a 3-table
      JOIN to two separate queries to resolve a MySQL "Illegal mix of collations"
      error that occurred when comparing VARCHAR columns across tables with
      different collation settings.
    - The existingMarkForForm check was guarded with a !marksLoading condition
      to prevent a false "already exists" alert from appearing when switching
      between students before the marks data had finished loading.

Work Done This Week:
  - Implemented staff login with JWT authentication.
  - Built staff sidebar navigation with protected routes.
  - Built Staff Dashboard with class summary stat cards.
  - Built Students page (class/section filtered list with search).
  - Built Mark Entry module — two-panel layout.
  - Implemented add, edit, delete, and UPSERT mark operations.
  - Fixed MySQL collation error in deleteMark and updateMark.
  - Fixed false "already exists" alert on student switch.
  - Fixed exam_date timezone shift using DATE_FORMAT in all queries.
  - Added percentage badge and exam-type grouping to marks table.

Week - 7  |  Staff Module — Part 2
           |  Assignment Module, Announcement Module,
           |  Feedback Module
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

This week focused on building the Assignment module — the most feature-rich
component of the Staff Portal — along with the Announcement and Feedback modules.

Assignment Module:
  The Assignment module allows teaching staff to create, manage, and monitor
  assignments for their class. Assignments are displayed as cards in a grid
  layout, each showing a colour-coded type badge, title, class and section,
  due date, a submitted/total student count chip, and a delete button.

  Assignment types and their colour codes:
    Assignment = Blue, Activity = Purple, Project = Cyan,
    Vacation/Holiday = Amber, Other = Grey.

  Create Assignment:
    A modal form allows the staff to create a new assignment with a title,
    description, assignment type, due date, and optional file attachments.
    Files (PDFs and images) are uploaded to Cloudinary via Multer middleware,
    and the returned secure URL is stored in the database alongside the
    assignment record.

  View Submissions Modal:
    Clicking an assignment card opens a submissions modal listing all students
    in the class with their submission status. Each row shows the student's
    roll number (styled as a blue badge), name, submission status, submitted
    date, notes, and a link to the submitted file if available.

  Extend Due Date:
    From within the submissions modal, the staff can set a new due date and
    time for the assignment. This uses a PATCH API endpoint
    (PATCH /homework/:id/extend-due-date). The CORS configuration in the
    server's app.js was updated to include 'PATCH' in the allowed methods list,
    resolving a CORS preflight error that blocked this request.

  Delete Assignment:
    A confirmation box appears inside the modal before deletion. Confirming
    deletes the assignment and all associated student submissions via a
    cascade delete operation on the backend.

  Expired Badge:
    Assignments whose due date has passed are automatically marked with an
    "Expired" badge on their card, giving staff a quick visual indicator of
    overdue assignments.

  Backend:
    The submitHomework endpoint checks the current timestamp against the
    assignment's due_date and returns a 403 PAST_DUE response if a student
    attempts to submit after the deadline, enforcing submission integrity.

Announcement Module:
  The Announcement module displays all published announcements relevant to
  faculty, fetched from the backend with a recipient filter set to "faculty".
  Announcements are shown in a card grid layout with title, content preview,
  posted date, and scheduled time if applicable. A search box filters
  announcements by title or content. Staff can view but not create or delete
  announcements, as announcement management is an admin-only function.

Feedback Module:
  The Feedback module enables staff to submit academic or behavioural feedback
  for individual students. The left panel shows the staff's student list with
  name and roll number (student ID was removed from the display as per
  requirement). Selecting a student loads a feedback form on the right with
  three category options: Academic (Exams/Marks), Behavioral, and General
  Remark. A free-text comments field allows the staff to write detailed
  observations. On submission, a success or error message is displayed.

Work Done This Week:
  - Built Assignment module — card grid layout with type badges.
  - Implemented Create Assignment modal with Cloudinary file upload.
  - Implemented View Submissions modal with student submission details.
  - Implemented Extend Due Date feature (PATCH API + CORS fix).
  - Implemented Delete Assignment with cascade delete confirmation.
  - Added Expired badge for overdue assignments.
  - Implemented deadline enforcement (403 PAST_DUE) on backend.
  - Built Announcement module (faculty-filtered, search, card layout).
  - Built Feedback module (category selection, free-text, student list).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

This final week of the Staff Module completed the student progress analytics
view for staff, the messaging and request handling modules, and resolved all
remaining bugs across both the Admin and Staff portals.

View Student Progress Module:
  The View Student Progress module gives teaching staff a visual overview of
  academic performance for all students in their assigned class. The module
  uses Recharts to render interactive charts powered by data fetched from the
  student_marks table.

  Class Overview:
    A horizontal bar chart displays all students' average scores in descending
    order (highest scorer at the top). A dashed reference line marks the class
    average. Hovering over any bar shows the student's name and exact average
    percentage in a dark tooltip.

  Individual Student View:
    Clicking a student from the class overview opens their individual progress
    page showing two charts:
      1. Subject-wise Average Bar Chart — a horizontal bar chart showing the
         student's average percentage per subject, with a reference line for
         the class average.
      2. Progress Trend Area Chart — an area chart plotting the student's
         average score across exam dates in chronological order. Interactive
         tooltips show the subject-wise breakdown of marks on hover.
    The RadarChart (Subject Strength) was removed from this view as per the
    project requirement.

  Compare Students:
    The staff can select any two students from a dropdown and compare their
    progress trends on a single overlaid line chart. Each student's line is
    rendered in a distinct colour, and separate tooltip blocks show each
    student's subject breakdown on hover.

  Date Fix:
    All exam_date values in the progress view queries were formatted server-side
    using DATE_FORMAT(exam_date, '%Y-%m-%d'). The frontend was updated to parse
    dates by string-splitting (dateStr.slice(0, 10)) rather than using the
    new Date() constructor, which was causing a UTC midnight timezone shift that
    displayed dates one day earlier than recorded.

Messages Module:
  The Messages module enables internal communication between staff members and
  the admin. Messages are displayed in a conversation-style list with sender
  name, message content, and timestamp. The frontend polls the messages API at
  regular intervals (every 30 seconds) to fetch new messages without requiring
  a manual page refresh.

Request / Approval Module:
  The Request/Approval module allows staff to view and action student requests
  submitted through the Student Portal. Each request shows the student's name,
  request type, reason, and current status. Staff can approve or reject requests,
  updating the status in the database via a PATCH API call.

Final Bug Fixes & Integration:
  The following bugs were identified and resolved during final integration
  testing:

  Bug 1 — MySQL "Illegal mix of collations":
    The deleteMark and updateMark functions originally used a 3-table JOIN
    that compared VARCHAR columns from tables with different collation settings
    (utf8mb4_general_ci vs utf8mb4_unicode_ci). This was resolved by splitting
    the operation into two separate queries — first fetching the mark ID, then
    performing the delete or update using only the marks table.

  Bug 2 — False "already exists" alert:
    When switching between students in the Mark Entry page, the existingMark
    check was firing before the new student's marks had finished loading,
    causing a false duplicate warning. This was fixed by adding a !marksLoading
    guard to the check.

  Bug 3 — Admin Student Progress showing 100% for all students:
    The initial implementation used max_marks as a placeholder for obtained_marks,
    resulting in all students showing 100%. This was replaced with a real API
    call to /api/marks that fetches actual obtained marks from the student_marks
    table.

  Bug 4 — Admin class dropdown only showing enrolled classes:
    The class and section dropdowns were originally built by scanning the
    allStudents array, so only classes with enrolled students appeared. This was
    fixed by fetching classes and sections directly from the classes and sections
    database tables via the existing /api/academic/classes and
    /api/academic/sections endpoints.

  Bug 5 — Duplicate exam labels on timeline chart:
    When the same exam type and subject appeared on two different dates, both
    data points showed the same label (e.g. "Midterm (English)" twice). Smart
    label deduplication was added: the code counts occurrences of each
    type+subject combination, and appends the date to the label only when the
    same combination appears more than once.

  Bug 6 — CORS error blocking PATCH requests:
    The extend-due-date API used the PATCH HTTP method, which was not listed in
    the server's CORS allowed methods. This was fixed by adding 'PATCH' to the
    corsOptions.methods array in app.js.

Work Done This Week:
  - Built View Student Progress module — class overview bar chart.
  - Built individual student view — subject bar chart and trend area chart.
  - Built compare students feature — overlaid line chart.
  - Removed RadarChart from staff progress view as per requirement.
  - Fixed exam_date timezone shift in all progress view queries.
  - Built Messages module (internal messaging with polling).
  - Built Request/Approval module (approve/reject with PATCH API).
  - Fixed all 6 bugs identified during integration testing.
  - Completed end-to-end testing of Admin and Staff Portal features.
  - Verified real marks data flow from Staff Mark Entry to Admin Progress View.
